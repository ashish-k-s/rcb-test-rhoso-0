#  Troubleshoot the OpenStack Control Plane

=== Troubleshoot the OpenStack Control Plane ===

Troubleshooting the OpenStack Control Plane involves identifying and resolving issues that prevent the control plane services from functioning correctly within a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) environment for Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP). Here are some common issues and their resolutions:

== Issues and Resolutions ==

* **Control Plane Pods not running or in CrashLoopBackOff state**

  * Symptoms: The OpenStack control plane pods do not start or repeatedly crash.
  * Causes: Incorrect configuration, insufficient resources (CPU/memory), or issues with container images.
  * Troubleshooting Steps:
    1. Verify the OpenStackControlPlane CRD for proper resource requests and limits.
        ```asciidoc
        # Example resource requests and limits
        spec:
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: "200m"
              memory: "512Mi"
            limits:
              cpu: "400m"
              memory: "1Gi"
        ```
    2. Check OpenStack Control Plane logs for errors using `oc logs <control-plane-pod-name>`.
    3. Ensure the OpenStack container images are up-to-date and accessible by RHOCP.

* **API service unreachable or slow responses**

  * Symptoms: The OpenStack API service is unresponsive or returns slow responses.
  * Causes: High load, misconfiguration, or database connection issues.
  * Troubleshooting Steps:
    1. Monitor resource usage (CPU/memory) on the control plane nodes and scale if necessary.
    2. Review OpenStack configuration for correct database settings and service endpoints.
        ```asciidoc
        # Example database configuration
        os_db:
          username: 'openstack'
          password: '<password>'
          host: '%{global_domain_name}'
          port: 5432
          dbname: 'openstack'
        ```
    3. Examine OpenStack logs for errors related to the database or API service.

* **Service deployment failures**

  * Symptoms: Control plane services like nova-api, glance-api, etc., fail to deploy.
  * Causes: Incorrect or missing environment variables, dependency issues, or misconfigured secrets.
  * Troubleshooting Steps:
    1. Verify the OpenStackControlPlane CRD for required environment variables and secrets.
        ```asciidoc
        # Example secret configuration
        os_services_default:
          auth_url: "http://<identity-service-ip>:5000"
          region_name: "RegionOne"
          memcached_servers: "<memcached-ip>:<port>"
          rabbit_hostname: "<rabbit-host>"
          rabbit_port: 5672
          rabbit_userid: 'openstack'
          rabbit_password: '<password>'
          service_token_ttl: 600
        ```
    2. Check for missing or misconfigured secrets in RHOCP's secret store.
    3. Review deployment logs to identify the root cause of failures and adjust configurations accordingly.

* **Network connectivity issues**

  * Symptoms: Control plane components cannot communicate with each other or external services due to network problems.
  * Causes: Incorrect network policies, firewall rules, or misconfigured node networking.
  * Troubleshooting Steps:
    1. Review the Network Configuration Policy and Network Attachment Definition for proper network isolation and service connectivity.
    2. Validate that required ports are open on control plane nodes' firewalls.
    3. Check routing configurations to ensure proper communication between services.
